# Daily Digest kit

A personal daily audio news brief that runs in **your own** Claude account. Pick your
topics, and every morning you get a private page with a 1 to 3 minute audio brief, the
full transcript with each word lighting up as it's read, direct links, and thumbs up/down
buttons that teach it what you like.

Sources: the web (Google News for your topics, Hacker News and Techmeme for tech, and a
few targeted searches) and, if you want, the newsletters already in your Gmail.

## Get started (about 10 minutes)
1. You need a paid Claude plan that includes Claude Code and Routines.
2. Open the intake form (your friend will send you the link), answer the questions, and
   copy the setup message it gives you.
3. Go to claude.ai/code, start a new session, paste the message, and let Claude set
   everything up. It will tell you if you need to flip any settings (usually: turn on
   full network access for your cloud environment, and attach Gmail if you want your
   newsletters included).

## What's in here
- `RUNBOOK.md`: what your daily run does, step by step.
- `SETUP.md`: what Claude does when you paste your setup message.
- `PROFILE.md`: your preferences format.
- `site/index.html`: your digest page. `intake/index.html`: the intake form.
- `discover.py` (web news), `resolve_links.py` (clean links), `tts.py` (audio + word
  timings), `build_digest.py` (page files), `notify.py` and `dropbox_upload.py` (optional).

Everything runs on free services: Edge TTS for the voice and public news feeds. Your
brief runs on your own Claude usage.

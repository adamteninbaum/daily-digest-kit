# Profile format

Each person's preferences, saved on their own digest page (database doc `config/profile`)
and copied into their Routine prompt as a backup. The intake form writes this for you.

- `newsletters`: read newsletters from Gmail. `outlook`: read newsletters from Outlook
  (Microsoft 365). Either, both or neither; missing means false.
- `newsletter_senders` (used for both Gmail and Outlook) empty means "find my
  newsletters automatically".
- `time` is when the brief should be ready; the Routine starts about 8 minutes earlier.
- `voice` is any Edge TTS voice name.
- `alerts.ntfy_topic`: optional; a long random name for the free ntfy app.
